# Digital Cinema Server API Library
 
### Goal


This library attempts to provide a functional and simple python package to manipulate, through their API, different digital cinema servers, players, and theatre management system.

The only brand/machine actually supported is Doremi DCP2000.

Coming next: 
 - Doremi TMS
 - AAM TMS
 - Unique TMS
 - GDC
 - Dolby ?
 - Sony ?
 - Qube (someday maybe, haha, I can't wait to code with their API again, it is a bloody joke)

### Usage

##### Lib Usage

Library is going to be documented in the docs folder.
It is not for now so just look at the code as it is commented for that.

##### Script Usage

Scripts have been created in order to use DCP2000 apis directly from command lines.
This scripts is named doremi.py and its usage can be found by typing :

   bin/doremiapi --help

That should be fairly simple.
